**Background:** Socioeconomic disparities are engrained in the US healthcare system and may extend to the prehospital cardiac arrest setting where mortality is high.

**Methods:** Using the National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) database, 150,003 cases were analyzed comparing socioeconomic status and cardiac arrest outcomes. Cardiac arrest outcomes were measured by the percent of cases that achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the percent of cases in which ROSC occurred in the Emergency Department (ED) as opposed to a prehospital setting which was a proxy for the length of time spent in cardiac arrest. Chi-square tests checked for statistical significance and effect size was measured using Pearson's r values and linear regression coefficients.

**Results:** Comparing neighborhood poverty level and the percent of cardiac arrest cases that achieved ROSC resulted in a Pearson's r value of 0.9424 (R2 = 0.8881, p < 0.005) and a linear regression coefficient of 2.088 (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.8881, 95% CI [1.059, 3.117]) meaning for every interval increase in poverty, the chance of an individual in cardiac arrest achieving ROSC decreases 2.09%. Comparing neighborhood poverty level and the percent of ROSC cases that occurred in the ED yielded a Pearson's r value of 0.9005 (R2 = 0.8109, p < 0.05) and a linear regression coefficient of 0.7701 (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.8109, 95% CI [0.254, 1.286]) meaning for every interval increase in poverty, the chance that ROSC is delayed increases 0.77%.

**Conclusions:** Low income individuals in cardiac arrest have a statistically significant lower probability of achieving ROSC and a higher chance of delayed ROSC.
