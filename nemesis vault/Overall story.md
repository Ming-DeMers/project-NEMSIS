What's wrong with EMS? Rural/suburban/urban

Organizational structure variability: EMS systems vary significantly in structure, providers, and financing across communities, leading to inconsistencies in care delivery

Resource limitations: Many EMS systems struggle with inadequate personnel, facilities, and equipment, affecting their ability to respond effectively to emergencies.

Data management challenges: Despite the critical importance of data in informing evidence-based practices, many EMS systems lack robust data collection and analysis capabilities.

Evolving roles and responsibilities: As EMS expands into non-emergent care like community paramedicine, there's a need for additional training and resources that may not be readily available.
