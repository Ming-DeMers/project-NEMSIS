## Description of the Thesis

The US 911 system emerged in the 1970s from a need to standardize and simplify emergency response. Despite the national movement, implementation occurred at the county level. As a result, response times, agency coverage, level of life support, and patient outcomes have varied greatly over the nation’s numerous rural towns and bustling cities.  
This thesis primarily focuses on identifying and analyzing "911 help deserts"—areas within the U.S. where EMS response times are significantly longer than the national average or where the quality of care provided is notably lower due to limited resources, inadequate coverage, or other systemic issues. To provide a contrasting view, the project also seeks to identify "help oases," areas where response times are shorter and the level of care is exemplary. By employing a comprehensive analysis of response times, agency coverage, and patient outcomes across different geographies—ranging from rural towns to urban centers—the project aims to shed light on the disparities within the current system. Ultimately, the thesis will propose a network-allocation strategy that optimizes the placement of ambulances and other resources to improve response times and patient care outcomes across the country, particularly in underserved areas. It will also propose other models, such as third-service ambulances or community paramedics, to supplement the 911 system.

## Description of preparatory coursework or experience

This thesis is supported by a unique combination of hands-on experience and formal education. I am a practicing EMT-B in a rural area of New York State. I have firsthand experience with the U.S. 911 emergency response system, with the difficulties, failures, and criticality of the system’s current state. In addition to my EMT experience, I have completed a number of courses, including data science, data communication, linear algebra, textual analysis, and machine learning.   
The combination of my practical experience as an EMT and my academic background in data science positions me well to undertake this comprehensive analysis of the U.S. 911 system. This blend of skills and experience will be critical in navigating the complexities of the NEMSIS dataset, performing statistical analyses, and making data-driven recommendations for improving the equity and efficiency of emergency medical services across the country.  
I also spent this last summer as a data science intern at a startup in the healthcare field. I have firsthand experience working with data, including cleaning, wrangling, and performing statistical analysis and model fitting. The work further reinforced my passion for working with data in the healthcare field for this thesis.

## Statement of Importance

This thesis is critically important within the fields of emergency management, public health, and healthcare policy. It addresses fundamental inequalities in the U.S. 911 emergency response system. Identifying "911 help deserts" is particularly significant because these areas represent regions where delayed response times and limited access to quality care can have life-threatening consequences for patients. By providing a comprehensive analysis of these disparities, the project aims to bring attention to regions that are currently underserved. Furthermore, by identifying "help oases" and analyzing the factors contributing to their success, the project will investigate the best practices that could be replicated in other areas. The findings from this project have the potential to inform policy decisions, guide resource allocation, and lead to systemic changes that could improve the equity and effectiveness of the 911 system.

## Timetable

**Phase 1**. Data Acquisition and Cleaning (Month 1-2): During this initial phase, the project will focus on cleaning the NEMSIS dataset, which contains millions of anonymized Patient Care Reports (PCRs). This phase will involve a thorough review of the data to ensure its completeness and relevance to the project’s objectives. Data cleaning will involve removing any incomplete or irrelevant entries, standardizing the data format, and ensuring that key variables such as response times, agency coverage, and patient outcomes are accurately captured. This phase is crucial for laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis and often takes the longest.  
**Phase 2**. Comparative Analysis of Response Times and Agency Coverage (Month 3): In this phase, the project will conduct a comparative analysis of EMS response times and agency coverage across different regions in the U.S. It will identify areas where response times significantly exceed the national average and where agency coverage is minimal or nonexistent. These areas will be classified as "911 help deserts." Conversely, areas with abundant resources and superior response times will be identified as "help oases." The results of this analysis will be used to map these regions and provide a representation of the disparities within the EMS system.  
**Phase 3:** Statistical Analysis of Patient Outcomes (Month 4): This phase will involve a detailed statistical analysis of patient outcomes in "911 help deserts" compared to "help oases." The analysis will explore correlations between patient outcomes (such as survival rates) and various factors, including response time, the type of life support provided (Basic Life Support vs. Advanced Life Support), and the quality of care received. The project will use statistical methods to determine whether the differences in patient outcomes between these regions are statistically significant and to identify any other variables that may influence these outcomes.  
**Phase 4:** Network-Allocation Analysis (Month 5-6): In this phase, the project will conduct a network-allocation analysis to optimize the placement of ambulances and other EMS resources. The analysis will consider factors such as population density, geographic barriers, and the current distribution of EMS resources. The goal is to develop a strategy that minimizes response times and ensures that all regions, particularly those identified as "911 help deserts," have access to timely and high-quality emergency care. This phase will consider ambulance placement, as well as alternative resources such as community paramedics or BLS fly cars, to identify the most effective strategy.  
**Phase 5**. Compilation of Findings and Preparation of Final Report (Month 7): The final phase of the project will involve compiling the findings from the previous phases into a comprehensive report. The report will include detailed maps and visualizations of "911 help deserts" and "help oases," statistical analyses of patient outcomes, and recommendations for improving the EMS system through optimized resource allocation. The final report will also include policy recommendations aimed at addressing the disparities identified in the study and improving the equity and effectiveness of the U.S. 911 system.
